# Why Should You Invest a Bike Sharing Business in Des Moines? 

This is a summary of the analytic work using the following data sources:
- NYC Citi Bike Data (Aug 2019) 
- Census USA Demographic Data (July 2018)
- Greater Des Moines Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Des Moines Area Sports Commission Data (2016) 
- New York City Mayor's Office Date (2016)
- Google Geocoding (2020)
- Datafinder (2020)

## Background 
NYC Citi Bike is a successful business, servicing millions of bikers.  

The objective of this study is to look at the data analysis of NYC Citi Bike, and to answer the following questions: 
- What are the key demographic characteristics of NYC Citi Bike customers? What are the age and gender split of the customers? 
- What is the population, age, and gender split in Des Moines? And what are the relevance to the demographic profile of NYC? 
- What effect does the demographic profile of Des Moines has on the potential of a bike sharing business? 

## Summary of Analysis

1) New York is the most visited city in the US, and bike sharing is probably common among tourists.  However there is enough evidence to show that most riders are residents, not tourists.  This creates an opportunity for Des Moines which doesn't enjoy as many tourists as NYC. 
2) Riders are fairly even across age group (18-65).  This means that age distribution has little relevance to the success of a bike sharing business, and we do not have to be concerned about whether Des Moines has a older or younger population. 
3) In terms of gender split, even though most riders are male, but in terms of gender split of the resident population in NYC, it shows that there are slightly more female than male in the most popular riding locations.  Des Moines has a slightly higher female population which simulates the gender split in the top stations.  This similarity further helps to justify the sustainability of a bike sharing business in Des Moines. 

**Conclusion**: 
Even though it appears that NYC has a much higher population, but it only means that a bike sharing business can be just as successful on a smaller scale, because the gender profile of Des Moines is very similar to the gender profile of the top stations in NYC.
