# Why Should You Invest a Bike Sharing Business in Des Moines? 

This is a summary of the analytic work using the following data sources:
- NYC Citi Bike Data (Aug 2019) 
- Census USA Demographic Data (July 2018)
- Greater Des Moines Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Des Moines Area Sports Commission Data (2016) 
- New York City Mayor's Office Date (2016)
- Google Geocoding (2020)
- Datafinder (2020)

## Background 
NYC Citi Bike is a successful business, servicing millions of bikers.  

The objective of this study is to look at the data analysis of NYC Citi Bike, and to answer the following questions: 
- Who are the users of bike sharing in NYC?  Are they residents or tourists? 
- What does the age and gender split of NYC bike users look like? 
- What is the gender split of the people in the top station locations in NYC? 
- What is the gender and age profile of Des Moines and NYC respectively, and how do these relate to the bikesharing business? 

## Summary of Analysis

1) New York is the most visited city in the US, and bike sharing is probably common among tourists.  However there is enough evidence to show that most riders are residents, not tourists.  This creates an opportunity for Des Moines which doesn't enjoy as many tourists as NYC. 
2) Riders are fairly even across age group (18-65).  This means that age distribution has little relevance to the success of a bike sharing business, and we do not have to be concerned about whether Des Moines has a older or younger population. 
3) Even though most riders are male, but it shows that the population in the most popular riding locations is fairly evenly distributed between male and female.  Des Moines has a fairly even gender split, similar to the gender split in the top stations.  This similarity further helps to justify the sustainability of a bike sharing business in Des Moines. 

**Conclusion**: 
Even though it appears that NYC has a much higher population, but it only means that a bike sharing business can be just as successful on a smaller scale in Des Moines. The gender profile of Des Moines is very similar to the gender profile of the top stations in NYC, so we can be confident that similar ridership behavior will result in Des Moines. 

## Tableau Story Summary

The first page is to draw the attention: most people would naturally think that there is no comparison between NYC and Des Moines, so a successful bike sharing business would have no relevance to Des Moines. 

<img alt = "Tableau story page 2" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/Story_2.png">

Page 2 shows that most customers are subscribers and not one-off customers, meaning that they are most likely residents who use bikesharing on a more regular basis. 

It also shows the most popular times are 8-9am, and 5-6pm, and these are the peak hours for people going to work and getting off work.  

Both charts combined showed that it's mainly residents using the service.  Therefore investors do not need to be concerned that Des Moines does not have enough tourists. 

<img alt = "Tableau story page 3" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/Story_3.png">

Page 3 shows that age has little discrimination towards bike usage, so that investors won't have to be conerned if Des Moines might have an older population. 

Page 3 also shows that male is the dominant user - so does it mean that a city has to have a higher male population to be successful? 

<img alt = "Tableau story page 4" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/Story_4.png">

Page 4 identifies the top stations in NYC, and the gender split of the top stations. 

It shows that even though the riders are mostly male, the resident gender profile is very different, it is more evenly split, and slightly more female than male. 

<img alt = "Tableau story page 5" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/Story_5.png">

Page 5 makes the comparison of gender split between NYC and Des Moines, showing that Des Moines is slightly more female-oriented than NYC.  This shows that the gender diversity in both cities is similar, and that it's consistent with the gender profile around the NYC top stations.  

Therefore the successful model in NYC can be leveraged in Des Moines.

<img alt = "Tableau story page 6" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/Story_6.png">

Page 6 answers any remaining question if Des Moines has enough 18-65 residents to use the bike service, and it shows that the 18-65 group in Des Moines is once again very similar to NYC.
